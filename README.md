Sam Stikeleather Challenge 03

I very much struggled with this project for quite some time, trying to figure out how to use Prompts to get an answer from the user to determine what characteristics they would like for their password and how to get them all to work in sync with the code. After using some online resources I found that it is possible and makes more sense to use Confirms to get those answers from the user. 

In this code you will find a password generator that can use uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters to generate a password that is anywhere between 8 - 128 characters long. 

On load the page begins to deliver confirms and a prompt to get the specifications for the password requirements, after those are answered, the initial password is stored in the console.log. After the initial generation if you run the page again with the "Generate Password" button, it will ask for the requirements again and it will then produce a new password in the box above the button.
